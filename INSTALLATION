### Squash Installation - version 0.6.1 ###

1) Install python (2.7.x preferred)

1.1) OPTIONAL: Install easy_install, making it super easy to install modules (http://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools)

1.2) Install South

     > easy_install South

     Or their releases: http://south.aeracode.org/docs/installation.html

1.3) Install simplejson using easy_install:

     > easy_install simplejson
     
     Or their releases: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/simplejson/

2) Obtain a copy of Squash! (If you're reading this, you probably already have it.)

3)  Install Squash into a web container. If you just want to test things out, you only
    have you move into the Squash directory:
    
    > cd squash-x.x.x/
    
    Then run the simple server:
    
    > ./manage.py runserver
    
    And it should just work! There's an administrative account configured with username
    'admin' and password 'admin'.
    
    Note however that this will run against (by default) a lightweight SQLite database
    that should NOT be used in production. It should only be used for tinkering.
    
4)  When/if you want to move Squash into a production environment, you'll want a better
    database, and a better container. I personally use MySQL and Apache/mod_python, so
    installation details for this method are below.

5)  Install Apache and mod_python, or whatever production environment you prefer.

    For this example, I'll be using Apache 2.4.2 with APR 1.4.6

    > wget http://mirror.symnds.com/software/Apache/httpd/httpd-2.4.2.tar.gz
    
    > tar xvf httpd-2.4.2.tar.gz
    > cd httpd-2.4.2/srclib/
    
    > wget http://mirrors.axint.net/apache//apr/apr-1.4.6.tar.gz 
    > tar xvf apr-1.4.6.tar.gz
    > mv apr-1.4.6/ apr/
    
    > wget http://download.nextag.com/apache/apr/apr-util-1.4.1.tar.gz
    > tar xvf apr-util-1.4.1.tar.gz
    > mv apr-util-1.4.1/ apr-util/
    
    > cd ..
    
    > ./configure --with-included-apr --with-included-apr-util
    > make
    > make install
